**CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator**
A Python-based simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms with both Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) modes.
This project is designed to help students and developers understand, visualize, and experiment with different CPU scheduling algorithms.

**Features**

Dual modes:
CLI Mode → Interactive terminal-based simulation.
GUI Mode → User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

**Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:**
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF NP)
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
Round Robin (RR)
Priority (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
Multi-Level Queue (MLQ)
Gantt Chart Visualization for better understanding.
Modular code structure with dynamic algorithm loading.
